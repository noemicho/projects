## Step by Step:

    The project structure is separated into two folders: Frontend and Backend.

    First, go to the frontend folder

        ./projects/project-noemi/frontend 

    You need to have node installed on your computer

    Run the command below to install the project dependencies on the frontend

        npm install

    Run the command below to start the frontend

        npm start

    After opening the frontend, go to the backend folder

        ./projects/project-noemi/backend

    Run the command below to install the project dependencies on the backend

        npm install

    Run the command below to run the backend

        npm run dev

    If you find problems, check your access to mongodb Atlas or the nodemon dependencies. Try installing globally:

        npm install -g nodemon

    By default, the project frontend is running on port localhost:3000 while the database backend is on port localhost:3333.
